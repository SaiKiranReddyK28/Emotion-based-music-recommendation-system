name: Data Collection and Preprocessing Challenges
about: 🖼️ Issues faced during data collection and preprocessing for model training.
title: '📊 Data Collection & Preprocessing Issue'
labels: 'data-collection, preprocessing'
assignees: 'Joseph Vijay Raj Lokku'

---

## 📝 Description
Several challenges were encountered while collecting diverse datasets and preprocessing them for training the emotion detection model.

### ❓ Issues Faced
- [ ] Inconsistent image sizes leading to varying input shapes for the model.
- [ ] Limited availability of labeled data for certain emotion classes.
- [ ] Computational overhead during preprocessing, slowing down model training.

### 📋 Steps to Resolve
1. **Data Normalization**: Implement a resizing function to standardize all image sizes.
2. **Data Augmentation**: Augment available data to balance classes (e.g., rotation, flipping).
3. **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Optimize the data preprocessing pipeline for speed (e.g., batch processing).
